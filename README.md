# Mapwize - Ionic Implementation
 
 Mapwize is the Indoor Mapping platform for creating new digital services inside buildings. Mapwize maps are easy to build and even easier to integrate in your Wayfinding, Workspace Management, Maintenance or Security applications.
 
 I have used their Javascript SDK to implement it in Ionic Application
